        This is a simple portfolio website inspired by my Google Sites work,
        rebuilt using HTML and CSS. My goal was to keep this clean
        while showing real progress in structure, navigation, and responsive design.

      <ul>
        <li>Hi, I’m Vincent DeMarco! A psychology driven communicator and relationship-builder. I specialize in understanding people, identifying their needs, and developing solutions that create real value. Whether I’m working in hospitality, leading in fraternity leadership roles, or supporting customers in fast-paced environments, I focus on building trust through strong communication, empathy, and professionalism.
I bring a unique value in sales: I know how to read situations, stay composed under pressure, and create meaningful connections quickly.
I’m currently pursuing a career in B2B Sales and SDR roles, where I can grow through mentorship, leadership development, and performance-driven results. And I’m excited to apply these strengths with teams that value growth, integrity, and collaboration.

        <li>At Dominican University, the parking situation is an immense struggle for many university students. With intense congestion, the university parking is constantly overfilled with cars. And because of this, many students experience academic struggles as well as the daily stress of finding a spot. I believe, however, that this solution can be solved through technology. My idea, using SpotHero as a main piece of inspiration, is to develop an app for students to encourage carpooling. Thus, increasing the amount of space for cars. My name is Vincent DeMarco and I introduce to you: StarPool
